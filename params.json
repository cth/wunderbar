It only requires a few SNPs to work well.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nWunderbar requires files that in plink format, see http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/ .\r\nMoreover, the files must be in the non-binary, with alleles recoded numerically and tab-separated.\r\nTo convert a binary plink file to the required format, use a command similar too:\r\n\r\n    plink --bfile my-binary-plink --recode12 --tab --out my-wunder-ready-plink\r\n\r\nWunderbar expects that you have two plink file-sets: A file-set with barcoding genotypes and \r\na file-set with the genotypes that you with to do barcoding against. Then to run barcoding\r\nyou would use a command like:\r\n\r\n   ./wunderbar --barcode-file my-barcodes --file my-test-genotypes --sampling-iterations 10000 --out results\r\n\r\nThis will create the files ```results.mismatch``` (candidate list of mismatching samples) and ```results.swaps```\r\n(candidate list of mixed up samples).\r\n\r\nThe full list of options are:\r\n\r\n    Usage: wunderbar [options]\r\n        -h, --help                       Display this screen\r\n        -f, --file plinkstem             The genotypes to be tested\r\n        -b, --barcode-file plinkstem     The barcode genotypes\r\n        -o, --out file                   Prefix of the output files\r\n            --ld-adjust iterations       Adjust for population LD structure between barcoding SNPs. Default number of iterations is 0 (Assume no LD). The more iterations the more precise the adjustment.\r\n            --sampling-iterations iterations\r\n                                     Number of iterations to use to calculate p-value from mismatch probability distribution\r\n        --peturb 0..1                A very small pertubation constant to ensure that no sample gets zero mismatch probability (default 0)\r\n        --dot-file file              Create .dot file for GraphViz to visualize swaps\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\n    Copyright (C) 2014 Christian Theil Have\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
